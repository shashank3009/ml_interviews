## Precision and Recall (Overview):

Precision and Recall are two important metrics used to evaluate the performance of classification models, especially in cases where the data is imbalanced or the cost of false positives and false negatives differs.

### 1. **Precision**:
Precision focuses on the accuracy of the **positive predictions** made by the model. It measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all instances that were predicted as positive.

$$
\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
$$

- **True Positives (TP)**: Correctly predicted positive instances.
- **False Positives (FP)**: Incorrectly predicted positive instances (actually negative but predicted positive).

**Interpretation**: Precision answers the question: *Of all the instances the model predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?* High precision means fewer false positives.

### 2. **Recall** (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):
Recall focuses on the model's ability to correctly identify all positive instances. It measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positive instances.

$$
\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
$$

- **False Negatives (FN)**: Instances that were actually positive but predicted as negative.

**Interpretation**: Recall answers the question: *Of all the actual positive instances, how many did the model correctly identify?* High recall means fewer false negatives.

### 3. **Trade-off Between Precision and Recall**:
There is usually a trade-off between precision and recall. When precision increases, recall might decrease and vice versa. This trade-off can be managed by adjusting the decision threshold for classifying a prediction as positive.

- **High Precision, Low Recall**: The model is conservative in predicting positives and will only predict positive when it’s very confident, leading to few false positives but possibly missing many actual positives (high false negatives).
  
- **High Recall, Low Precision**: The model tries to capture as many positives as possible, leading to few false negatives, but might misclassify more negatives as positives (high false positives).

### 4. **F1 Score**:
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two. It is useful when you need a single metric to compare models, especially when you want to balance precision and recall.

$$
\text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
$$

### Example:
Consider a medical test for detecting a rare disease:
- **Precision**: Of all patients the model identified as having the disease, how many truly have the disease? This is important if you want to reduce false alarms.
- **Recall**: Of all patients who actually have the disease, how many did the model correctly identify? This is important if you want to minimize missed diagnoses.

In summary, precision is about minimizing false positives, while recall is about minimizing false negatives. The right balance depends on the problem you’re trying to solve.
